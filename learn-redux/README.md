# Description
This is just me practicing redux and adding some notes for whenever I use it in the future.

## Installation
```npm install redux react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit```

## Setting up a store
1. Create a store folder and set up the store there
2. Create slices for different things you need to do in your code (ex. authentication)
3. Put those actions in the store 
4. Wrap the App component in index.js with ```<Provider store={store}>```

## Using slice states and dispatching actions
